# Shattered-Union-Editor

The Shattered Union Editor, or SUEditor, is an editing program for Shattered Union, released in 2005 and developed 
by PopTop Software. Its primary goal is to allow for the editing of game files that change how the game is played. 
The creation of new maps and/or editing existing maps for the game are outside the scope of this project.

Currently, the project is concerned with exposing and editing the individual units of the game defined in 
"UnitTypes.dat". Thus will, of course, lead to the ability to add and delete units.

As the project progresses more data files will be included in the project. With each new data file added, more
aspects of the game will be exposed to editing.
